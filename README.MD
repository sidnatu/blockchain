I destroyed my commit history on accident.

My goal with this is to develop a blockchain of my own, and develop my own miner that conducts the PoW needed to add a block to a chain.
Currently, I have a working CLI and blockchain library.

Want to add a feature that also displays current number of coins mined (CLI probably)
