# Python Blockchain with a De1SoC miner.

This project is my attempt to create a De1SoC miner to mine my own blockchain made in Python. I got the inspiration to make this by following a blockchain in Python tutorial that is similar to how Bitcoin works.

## How it's made

**Tools Used:** Verilog, Python, De1SoC, ChatGPT \(for code explanation)>

> The blockchain made in Python was made using following an online tutorial, linked [here](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).>
> The miner was made using a combination of ChatGPT to explain code and Google to find tricky code to implement, like the UART reciever/transmitter.

#### Lessons Learned

Don't be afraid to use code from a stack exchange, but make sure to understand it.

#### Future Features

Want to add a feature that also displays current number of coins mined (CLI probably)
